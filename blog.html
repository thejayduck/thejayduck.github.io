<h3>Why I Started Writing ‚ùì</h3>
<p>I consider myself a bookworm, especially when it comes to Japanese light novels. The unique stories authors in East Asia come up with always amazed me. I have to agree that some of the books they write are simply... weird to put in simple terms, but out of the bunch, some gems shine through.
I&#x27;ve especially been obsessed with <strong>Jobless Reincarnation</strong> light novel that I read all 15 volumes within three months.</p>
<!-- -->
<p>The way the author expands on its already amazing world, and characters simply astonished me.
Anyways back to the topic, after years of procrastinating on writing, I finally took my first step to improve my writing abilities by writing a... <strong>fanfic</strong>. Before you leave, no I did not write anything weird or sexual, I simply wanted to create a simple romantic spin-off of the series <strong>Higurashi</strong>. The reason I chose Higurashi is that one can create their own; Horror, Mystery, and Romance story with it. And with its already amazing cast of characters, it saves the person time to focus more on the plot of their spin-off.</p>
<h3>What I Have Learned in the Past Week ‚úçüèª</h3>
<p>For the short story, I challenged myself to write it within a week! And let me tell you, it was quite the ride that I am willing to take several more times. I had so much fun writing their specific character traits on paper, which allowed me to learn so much within the deadline I had set myself up to.
I now have a deeper understanding of how each character reacts to certain situations, and with each other. The story has a lot of flaws, and they are to be expected, that&#x27;s why I asked 2 of my close friends to read it once I was done with it. They both gave me their criticism on it, which I profoundly appreciate. Although writing is not going to be my future career, I will keep improving myself with more short stories before meddling with original stories of my own.</p>
<h3>Afterword</h3>
