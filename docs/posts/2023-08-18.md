# Switching to a Button Phone (Sort of) üì±

Nowadays it might come off as a weird thing to get a smaller phone with buttons at that.

<h3 id="phones-i-have-used">Phones I've Used ‚è≤Ô∏è</h3>

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever owned a flagship phone in my life, reason being is that I never and still don‚Äôt understand spending large sums of money just to get features are don't add up to the experience majority of the time. Sure you can argue against it by saying that it is future-proofing, but most people still end up buying the new version after a year of using the previous flagship model anyways.

#### Samsung E390

[Samsung E390](https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_e390-1770.php) is the first phone I've ever owned. I don't quite remember what my experience using this was, but I vividly remember using **0.facebook.com** often on this phone. Also if I am not wrong this phone is still with me.

[Samsung Galaxy Pocket Neo S5310](https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_pocket_neo_s5310-5391.php) is the first ever touch-capable phone I've owned. I used it during elementary school (so it lasted me minimum 3-4 years). Also as expected by its small form factor, it was quite slow and the battery drained quite fast. I did used to play some _Clash of Clans_ on it but it wasn't a pleasent experience thanks to its screen size. To this day this phone is with me but it is stuck in a bootloop which I haven't tried fixing yet.

I don't really remember that much about this phone, but I used to use 0.facebook.com quite a lot on it.                                    |
I've had so much fun using this small soap sized phone, it wasn't the most powerful but it sure lasted quite a while.                      |
I remember getting really annoyed at this phone mostly because of its hideous performance, but like the others it did serve me well.       |
I wouldn't say that I daily drived this phone, rather I played around with it, modded it etc, and it still lives in my cabinet.            |
To this day I use this phone (Nowadays as an emulator device), not the most powerful but certainly good enough to emulate games up to Wii. |
Urgh, not gonna like I should've researched more about KaiOS before making this purchasing decision, the platform is good as dead.         |
This phone has brought me a lot of joy, modern technology / operating system and T9 keypad is just chefs kiss.                             | -->

You might be asking "Why would you do that in this day and age?!", and a simple answer to that would be "Why not?".
