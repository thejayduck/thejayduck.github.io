This is the first time I am writing a review for anything really, and I will mostly be focusing on the drawing experience rather than pure performance. This blog post is probably going to be concise one as I don't want to drag out something as simple as a tablet review as an artist.

# Comparison Table

First things first, heres a simple comparison table between the two devices.

| Feature      | Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+                           | Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite 2020                  |

# Why the Upgrade?

Quite simple really, it was all about performance. The Tab S6 Lite is certainly still really good when it comes to note taking and other light tasks, but whenever I try to draw something complicated the drawing app would start lagging and eventually crashing. Hence the reason why I've been uploading mostly simple shaded, or just straight up sketches on my gallery. The 4GB ram really started to show its incompetence as new android versions and apps started to roll out.

# Drawing Experience

Per usual the wacom pen tech samsung tablets use is simply the best. The difference between the S6 Lite and S9+ is really close except the fact that S9+ feels more responsive thanks to its 120hz screen.

I use the Wacom One pen for drawing rather than the provided spen as it is too thin and uncomfortable to be used for long sessions.
