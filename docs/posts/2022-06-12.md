# A Happy Birthday Present! üéÇ

<h2>Happy Birthday üéä</h2>

Happy 19th birthday [nobbele](https://nobbele.dev), I hope all your future dreams come true!

It should be obvious now that this post is dedicated to my friend [nobbele's](https://nobbele.dev) **19th** birthday! I've been a friend of his ever since **2017**, and I am truly grateful to have met him. In **5** years we worked on countless projects together, some were abandoned, and some were somewhat complete.

[Novel Tracker][noveltracker], [Belfast Bot][belfastbot] were our biggest projects to date.

<h3>The Birthday Project üéÅ</h3>

Coming up with an idea was quite easy actually, a few months ago he kept pestering me to draw a character for his [Catch the Beat](https://ctbw.nobbele.dev/) game. With the idea in mind, I started working on the rough sketch.

#### The Initial Sketch

This was my first attempt at chibi-esque character ever. I was kinda skeptical at how the final result would look like, but it was easier than I thought.
The initial sketch had 2 different iterations; the issue with the first one was, that it was in a 3/4 view, which looked out of place. Luckily, the second sketch came out better than the initial one.

#### Cleaning the Sketch

I then had to re-draw the sketch on a bigger canvas, to have a bit more freedom. I also refined the majority of the sketch. For some weird reason, I thought this looked acceptable. And oh boy, I don't even want to know what I thought when I started coloring it, but thankfully I came back to my senses before it was too late. Hence was the reason why I used this as a sketch for the next iteration instead.

#### Drawing the Line-art

At this point the drawing was coming along nicely. Although, I've never been a fan of drawing line-art, like ever, I had to deal with it to deliver a good present I was proud of. To my surprise it came about way better than I anticipated, additionally I was going to add more line weight but decided not to complicate stuff I wasn't used to yet. Immediately after finishing the line-art, I started coloring it.

#### Coloring

I hate coloring just as I hate line-art, but I had to color it whether I liked it or not. And I am glad I colored it, during the process I learned a lot of new techniques that felt right for my style. My blending technique isn't perfect yet, but hey last time I colored something was nearly a year ago (Excluding the Shiba and the Sculpture, I received some help on those.)
Anyways, after the coloring process, I realized some errors in my drawing, and immediately opened up [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/) to tinker on it.

#### Adjusted Colors

Lastly, I imported the image on [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/) and used liquify tool to adjust its proportions and played around with the colors to further enhance its looks. And with that, the short project came to an end.

I definitely learned a lot more about coloring and other processes of art which I don't like. But the effort was worth it.

<h2>Afterword</h2>
I hope you enjoyed this short post. This post was quite difficult to put into words for me, mostly because I wasn't sure about what to write down, so I just went with the flow. I will definitely make another post on the progress of my custom card deck in the upcoming weeks or months.
