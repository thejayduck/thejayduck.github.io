Over the past few months, the way I draw my characters have drastically changed, which is why I am painstakingly having a slow process with the drawings.

Not to mention, I am also working on the designs of the cards. My goal is to make them as simple as possible while retaining the modern look on them. I am using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) for the card designs, the UI is not that intuitive but it will have to do for this project.

## Upcoming Post Preview

The images you see below are still **work in progress** and the front view contains a colored version of **Sonozaki Mion** which I don't want to reveal just yet... This is why I decided to blur both of them.

# Afterword

And with that comes an end to another blog post! I would love to keep progress updates on my card deck longer, but it is kinda hard when the only changes are newly drawn characters and such. Anyways, I hope you enjoyed this short read once again... See you at the next one where I might reveal the card designs and some finished characters.

#### Short Updates

> **2022/08/22** - Yeah... Uhh... During the line-art process of **Sonozaki Mion**, I may have lost track of things, and accidentally finished the whole drawing. Therefore, I will be doing the line-art and coloring process of each character at the same time!

> **2022/08/24** - After hours of moving my stylus around the glass surface, I finished drawing **Houjou Satoko**! Although I hate her personality, the drawing looks way too cute.

> **2022/08/26** - Damn! I am on a roll these days, already done with 3 of the characters... out of 14... Anyways, **Hanyuu** turned out pretty good! I am not a fan of coloring my drawings but lately it's been growing on me.

> **2022/08/27** - And another drawing done! I finished **Furude Rika's** line-art and base colors yesterday, so I only had to shade her this morning. Coloring wise she turned out out to be best! I am planning on releasing a new blog post once I am done with coloring **Rumiko Chie** or **Sonozaki Shion**, but no promises.

> **2022/08/27** - For some reason I struggled while drawing **Rumiko Chie** more than I should, I assume it is because I've been drawing non-stop for the past few days. I am planning on redrawing her hair but for now, I am not going to bother myself with it. Oh also, make sure check my [Gallery](/gallery)!

> **2022/08/31** - I took a short break after drawing **Rumiko Chie**, this short rest was much needed for my creative mind to rest. Anyhow, I **sort of** finished drawing **Sonozaki Shion** and **Ryuugu Rena**, somehow those 2 drawings turned out way better than the ones I draw a few days prior, so I am planning on revisiting them and re-drawing / re-coloring certain aspects of those characters.

> **2022/09/08** - Another week passed by, this week I focused on recoloring most characters, namely **Sonozaki Mion, Rumiko Chie, Furude Rika, Hanyuu and Satoko**. Other than that I finished drawing **Takano Miyo**, however, I am not that happy with the result so I might redraw her at a later date.

> **2022/09/09** - Just now, I finished redrawing **Takano Miyo's**; hair, eyes, and skin. I swear this is the last short update before I reveal the first half of the characters. I've been solely focused on making my drawings as good as they can be before showcasing them! Please look forward to them!
