# GoedWare Game Jam Entry ðŸŽ®

<h2>The Entry âœ¨</h2>

On June 4th my friends and I decided to participate in [GoedWare Game Jam #5](https://itch.io/jam/goedware-game-jam-5). The last game jam I joined was [Winter VN Jam 2020](https://itch.io/jam/winter-vn-jam-2020/rate/826293). As the name suggests its been almost **2 years** since I've participated in a game jam. Although my role was minor compared to what I did in my previous entries, I had plenty of fun helping with the development. For this game jam I teamed up with [nobbele](https://nobbele.dev) and [semikoder](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCey0WKLnnYF_98GsUsiE22w) whom I haven't done any project with for the past **4 years**.

The **main theme** of the jam was **Love, Death & Robot** combined with the subtheme of **The Price of Freedom**. I will be talking about my own experience in this blog post, you can learn more about the project in our [itch.io](https://semikoder.itch.io/project-biobot) page. The whole development process went by quite smoothly, we did have some last minute bugs appear out of nowhere, which is a typical thing that happens in every game jam. After my friends solved the issues we submitted the game.

Here is a short description of the game from our page:

> In an era in which technology develops at a rapid speed, Biobotics Technologies have introduced a mechanization program to amplify human workloads. With their system almost ready for production, they began recruiting volunteers for human trials. You are promised a large sum of money for participating in this program, but be aware, that it might come with a catch.

<h2>My Role ðŸ’¼</h2>

As I mentioned above, my role in this jam was minor. I **voiced a character**, **worked on some models**, **helped with some scenery** and **overall writing**. Other than that I didn't do any programming related stuff because my finals were coming up.

Anyways, when it comes to voice-acting, to put it bluntly I have no experience in it. This was my first ever voice-acting performance. I had plenty of fun but it felt weird to express feelings to the things you read aloud and add a bit of character to it. The whole recording process took me around 1-2 hours and it was quite intriguing, I had to re-record certain lines 2 to 3 times to get it just right.

Additionally I haven't done any sort of modelling for the past 4 year, for this project I did work on models such as **Laser Emitter**, and a **Mirror** that reflected the laser. Unfortunately those features didn't make the cut due to time restraints.

<h3>Postmortem ðŸ“¼</h3>

Here is a postmortem video of how our game jam went.

<h2> Afterword </h2>

Yup another short blog, I would like to write more but I can't really do that when my role was in this project was minor. Anyhow, I hope you liked this short blog and make sure to try our [game](https://semikoder.itch.io/project-biobot)!
