# Custom Deck of Cards Part 4 🃏

Drawing the first half of the character cast took... 9 days in total. Don't get me wrong this progress is pretty darn good, but I am still shocked at my own speed. This progress might slow down on the upcoming weeks, or even days, because of good circumstances. But I doubt it will take longer than a month.

## The First Half

|     🂡 Ace     |      🂮 King       |      🂫 Jack       |    🂭 Queen    |  🂨 Card of 8  |  🂣 Card of 3  |   🂩 Card of 9   |    🂤 Card of 4    |    🃏 Joker     |     🂢 Card of 2     |  🂧 Card of 7  |
| :-----------: | :---------------: | :---------------: | :-----------: | :-----------: | :-----------: | :-------------: | :---------------: | :-------------: | :-----------------: | :-----------: |
| ![Mion][mion] | ![Satoko][satoko] | ![Hanyuu][hanyuu] | ![Rika][rika] | ![Chie][chie] | ![Rena][rena] | ![Shion][shion] | ![Takano][takano] | ![Oryou][oryou] | ![Keiichi][keiichi] | ![Irie][irie] |
| Sonozaki Mion |   Houjou Satoko   |      Hanyuu       |  Furude Rika  |  Chie Rumiko  | Ryuuguu Rena  | Sonozaki Shion  |    Takano Miyo    | Sonozaki Oryou  |   Maebara Keiichi   | Kyosuke Irie  |

> Most of the characters you see above are not yet finalized.

I am quite happy with majority of the results so far. Despite the fact that I still find coloring quite challenging.

## Why the Slow Pace?

Recently, I've started experimenting with different ways of coloring/shading my characters, which greatly slowed down my pace. I probably redrew _specifically Mion's hair_ at least 5 times.

| First Iteration  | Second Iteration  | Third Iteration  | Fourth Iteration  |
| :--------------: | :---------------: | :--------------: | :---------------: |
| ![First][mion-1] | ![Second][mion-2] | ![Third][mion-3] | ![Fourth][mion-4] |

Obviously, Mion wasn't the only character I altered quite a bit. **Rumiko Chie, Hanyuu, and Takano Miyo** were also altered quite drastically.

# Afterword

By the time I am finalizing this blog post, I have already _finished_ drawing **Takano Miyo** and started working on **Sonozaki Oryou**. The overall pace is still consistent, and I should be done with all the characters in no time! See you later in **part 5**.

#### Short Updates

> **2022/09/14** - Just finished Sonozaki Oryou! The boys line-up should go much smoother compared to girls, due to their overall basic designs.

> **2022/09/21** - Maebara Keiichi is done!... Somewhat. 👍🏻

> **2022/10/03** - Done with Kyosuke Irie! Took my sweet time with a bit of procrastination as well...
