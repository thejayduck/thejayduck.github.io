# Custom Deck of Cards Part 4

<h3 id="that-was-fast"> That Was Fast üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è </h3>

Drawing the first half of the character cast took... 9 days in total. Don't get me wrong this progress is pretty darn good, but I am still shocked at my own speed. This progress might slow down on the upcoming weeks, or even days, because of good circumstances. But I doubt it will take longer than a month.

I am quite happy with majority of the results so far. Despite the fact that I still find coloring quite challenging.

<h3 id="slow-pace"> Why the Slow Pace? ü¶• </h3>

Recently, I've started experimenting with different ways of coloring/shading my characters, which greatly slowed down my pace. I probably redrew *specifically Mion's hair* at least 5 times.

|First Iteration|Second Iteration|Third Iteration|Fourth Iteration|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|![First][mion-1]|![Second][mion-2]|![Third][mion-3]|![Fourth][mion-4]|

Obviously, Mion wasn't the only character I altered quite a bit. **Rumiko Chie, Hanyuu, and Takano Miyo** were also altered quite drastically.

By the time I am finalizing this blog post, I have already *finished* drawing **Takano Miyo** and started working on **Sonozaki Oryou**. The overall pace is still consistent, and I should be done with all the characters in no time! See you later in **part 5**.

#### Short Updates

> **2022/09/14** - Just finished Sonozaki Oryou! The boys line-up should go much smoother compared to girls, due to their overall basic designs.
> **2022/09/21** - Maebara Keiichi is done!... Somewhat. üëçüèª
