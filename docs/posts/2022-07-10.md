# Custom Deck of Cards Part 2 🃏

At last! I finished the second year of my university without any issues. This however doesn't mean I will update the card game frequently, since I still have things to do in real life. Without further ado, here are the characters I have finished so far.

|     🂡 Ace     |      🂮 King       |      🂫 Jack       |    🂭 Queen    |  🂨 Card of 8  |  🂣 Card of 3  |   🂩 Card of 9   |    🂤 Card of 4    |    🃏 Joker     |
| :-----------: | :---------------: | :---------------: | :-----------: | :-----------: | :-----------: | :-------------: | :---------------: | :-------------: |
| ![Mion][mion] | ![Satoko][satoko] | ![Hanyuu][hanyuu] | ![Rika][rika] | ![Chie][chie] | ![Rena][rena] | ![Shion][shion] | ![Takano][takano] | ![Oryou][oryou] |
| Sonozaki Mion |   Houjou Satoko   |      Hanyuu       |  Furude Rika  |  Chie Rumiko  | Ryuuguu Rena  | Sonozaki Shion  |    Takano Miyo    | Sonozaki Oryou  |

Yup, 5 new drawings; **Chie**, **Rena**, **Shion**, **Takano** and **Oryou**.

> **NOTE: I am aware most characters are facing left, reason being I am used to drawing heads in that position. Every sprite will be modified before the printing phase.**

## My Thoughts on the Character Sketches

|   Character    | Thoughts                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| :------------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  Chie Rumiko   | From an overall art perspective, I am not _that_ happy from the outcome, her face does look cute and all, but this alone does not satisfy me. Which is why I am planning on **redrawing her**.                                                                                                                                                |
|  Ryuugu Rena   | The Rena you are seeing is the **second iteration**. The previous iteration looked so hideous that I hated every pixel of it. But thankfully I redrew her before the publication of this post. She does look very **adult** like, but I will probably adjust her facial structure a bit during line-art phase to make her seem a bit younger. |
| Sonozaki Shion | Out of the bunch Shion is one of the characters that came out better than I expected, but this doesn't mean I am 100% happy with the result. Hence the reason I am planning on **redrawing her body**.                                                                                                                                        |
|  Takano Miyo   | To be honest, I have nothing to say about her, her sketch simply looks amazing, especially the M1911 pistol which I used **blender** to render.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Sonozaki Oryou | She came out way better than I anticipated, she is the first ever old person I drew, and not going to lie but I am kind of proud of myself.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Card Sizes

Additionally, I bought 2 card decks as a reference for the size.

|     Normal Size     |      Smaller Size       |
| :-----------------: | :---------------------: |
| ![CardBig][cardBig] | ![CardSmall][cardSmall] |
|    Height: 8.7cm    |       Height: 8cm       |

Besides their obvious difference in height, they are quite similar in width. With that being said, I am leaning more towards the **smaller size** considering it's more **portable** and more **stylish**.

## Remaining Characters

|    🂢 (Card of 2)    |     🂥 (Card of 5)     |   🂦 (Card of 6)   | 🂧 (Card of 7) |   🂪 (Card of 10)    |
| :-----------------: | :-------------------: | :---------------: | :-----------: | :-----------------: |
| ![Keiichi][keiichi] | ![tomitake][tomitake] | ![Ooishi][ooishi] | ![Irie][irie] | ![Satoshi][satoshi] |
|   Maebara Keiichi   |    Tomitake Jirou     |  Kuraudo Ooishi   | Kyousuke Irie |   Houjou Satoshi    |
|    **Finished**     |     **Finished**      |   **Finished**    | **Finished**  |    **Finished**     |

> **DISCLAIMER: The drawings above are NOT mine! They are the original sprites from the game. The images are merely a reference for the reader.**

Well, I guess it is time to draw the males. I feel the most challenging ones here will be **Kuraudo Ooishi** and **Tomitake Jirou**, considering I have never drawn someone fat or muscular.

# Afterword

Phew, another blog post done. When I first implemented this blogs to my website, I never thought I would be _this_ into writing blogs but here I am releasing 2 posts every month. Well, I hope to see you on my next blog post!

#### Short Updates

> Make sure to check my [Gallery](/gallery) where I post my drawings. This page is a new addition for my website, I hope you like it!

> **2022/07/21** - Drawing **Keiichi Maebara** was quite the challenge, **particularly his pose**. It took me **4 iterations** before I could actually draw a pose I approved. Anyways, I am closing in on the line-art phase of the process.

> **2022/07/26** - July 10th was **Mion Sonozaki's** birthday, make sure to check the drawing on my [DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/thejayduck/art/Mion-Sonozaki-Birthday-923781589).

> **2022/08/04** - I finished **Kyosuke Irie** the yesterday, and he came out like a character out of a _Shoujo Manga_. Nonetheless, I am quite happy the way he turned out! The upcoming sketch will be **Tomitake Jirou**, if I feel productive enough he should be done by the end of this week! I will be making a new blog post when I finish drawing the remainder.

> **2022/08/05** - Turns out that I felt productive immediatly after Irie's drawing. Now that I am done with **Tomitake Jirou**, it's time to tackle down the hardest one yet! **Kuraudo Ooishi**.

> **2022/08/11** - Drawing **Kuraudo Ooishi** was.. quite annoying. Drawing his body was easier than I thought, but I had all sorts of issues while drawing his face, so I had to look at many reference images of **Ooishi** and drawings with similar head shapes to get the right proportions. With that being out of the way, **Houjou Satoshi** is the last character I have to sketch before the line-art process begins!

> **2022/08/19** - At last! I finished **sketching** every character for the card deck.. I was planning on finishing them all once I started, though my art style wouldn't be as consistent, so I refrained from doing so. Alongside the sketch of **Houjou Satoshi** I also worked on some **prototype card designs**, they are quite simple in design yet they retain a modern look. Next progress blog will hopefully come out by the end of this week! Please look forward to it, since I am planning on showcasing all the characters and the prototype card designs before initiating the **line-art** phase of the character art!
