# Custom Deck of Cards Part 1 üÉè

## Why I am Doing This ‚ùì

Why not? I mean, just the thought of having a physical something made by **you** is an amazing feeling in my opinion. I get to work on a new form of project and also, I can use this project as an excuse to improve my art.

# What Inspired Me? ü§î

This whole idea of making my own card deck arose when I started playing card games such as **Uno** more often.
Another factor that helped me is during the development of the Tamagochi game, my friends and I decided to print a dress-up sticker set of the dog with some in-game clothing. And with that my passion for for physical objects of projects I work on was re-embarked.

But before I actually decided on a card game however, I thought about printing a custom laptop sticker, but I quickly scrapped that idea because, it would just ruin the aesthetic of my laptop and I had already printed more than enough stickers in the past.
After spending more time thinking about what I could possibly bring into the real-world, I thought about working on my own card deck. Reason being, they are cheap to produce and I just needed to draw a crap load of characters.

<br/>

As for what I was going to draw, I first thought about drawing original characters, however in my case, I prefer drawing a different character every time I draw something new, hence I never settle on a character that I can actually call 'original'. With this issue on hand, I decided to draw the cast of Higurashi characters. You might ask; "But why?", and I genuinely have no clue why, maybe it's because I'm too invested in the story for the past few months, or maybe it's because I can't think of any other characters to draw about.

# Current Progress üìä

The deck will consist a set of 52+1 playing cards and a joker card. In total 13+1 characters. Each character except the joker will be printed 4 times.

<br/>

So far, I roughly sketched out 4 characters, these include;

|     üÇ° Ace     |      üÇÆ King       |      üÇ´ Jack       |    üÇ≠ Queen    |
| :-----------: | :---------------: | :---------------: | :-----------: |
| ![Mion][mion] | ![Satoko][satoko] | ![Hanyuu][hanyuu] | ![Rika][rika] |
| Sonozaki Mion |   Houjou Satoko   |      Hanyuu       |  Furude Rika  |

> **NOTE: The images are resized, the original resolution is around 1200x2000.**

<br/>

I am also planning on adding characters such as;

|    üÇ¢ (Card of 2)    | üÇ£ (Card of 3) |   üÇ§ (Card of 4)   |     üÇ• (Card of 5)     |   üÇ¶ (Card of 6)   | üÇß (Card of 7) | üÇ® (Card of 8) |  üÇ© (Card of 9)  |   üÇ™ (Card of 10)    |   üÉè (Joker)    |
| :-----------------: | :-----------: | :---------------: | :-------------------: | :---------------: | :-----------: | :-----------: | :-------------: | :-----------------: | :-------------: |
| ![Keiichi][keiichi] | ![Rena][rena] | ![Takano][takano] | ![tomitake][tomitake] | ![Ooishi][ooishi] | ![Irie][irie] | ![Chie][chie] | ![Shion][shion] | ![Satoshi][satoshi] | ![Oryou][oryou] |
|   Maebara Keiichi   | Ryuuguu Rena  |    Takano Miyo    |    Tomitake Jirou     |  Kuraudo Ooishi   | Kyousuke Irie |  Chie Rumiko  | Sonozaki Shion  |   Houjou Satoshi    | Sonozaki Oryou  |
|    **Finished**     | **Finished**  |   **Finished**    |     **Finished**      |   **Finished**    | **Finished**  | **Finished**  |  **Finished**   |    **Finished**     |  **Finished**   |

<br/>

The card each character will represent is already decided, but I might tweak some of them before the printing phase.

## Other Requirements üìù

At the moment I am planning on making the cards the size of mini playing cards, the reason being, that they are smaller and more portable than regular poker cards.
And so I searched around the internet until stumbled upon this amazing **[playing card template](https://www.magicianmasterclass.com/post/playing-card-template)** that provides high-quality card templates.

For the choice of materials, I settled on, **350gr paper with rounded edges, matte coated surface, and size of 5.4cm x 8cm**.

As for casing, my initial plan was to have a standard paper box, but one of my friends suggested that I use a custom printed plastic case instead. With that thought in mind I found some outstanding free 3D printable models from **[Cults3D](https://cults3d.com/en)**. Additionally, I will edit the model of my choice to engrave a custom Higurashi logo on it.

# Afterword

I wasn't planning on writing another blog post so soon and this long, but for some reason, I feel the need to write these, even though I know almost no one except 2 of my friends read them. Even if that is indeed the case I am happy to be able to write these posts on occasion. Thank you once again for reading this blog post, I will probably write another or update this one when I draw more characters. See you later üëãüèª!

#### Short Updates

> **2022/05/21** - I am well aware the update to the post happened earlier than I expected, but I just finished the rough sketch of **Chie Rumiko**. She came out cuter than I thought. I am planning on showcasing the new characters in the upcoming progress update.

> **2022/05/22** - Wow, another update! I just finished the sketch of **Ryuuguu Rena**. Next in line is **Sonozaki Shion**. If everything goes smoothly or I am not lazy, I should have a finished sketch of her in the upcoming week.

> **2022/05/28** - Phew, I guess I am done with **Shion Sonozaki**. I am not super happy of the sketch, but this will do for now, I might redraw her if I feel like it. Next in line is **Takano Miyo**.

> **2022/06/02** - Drawing **Takano Miyo** was enjoyable, I am particularly pleased with her eye and overall expression. Also the last female on the deck is **Sonozaki Oryou**. In all honesty, I've never drawn an old person in my life, and I feel like everything's going to go wrong, but I will try my best to make her look somewhat good. When I finish drawing Oryou I will post a blog post showcasing all 9 characters I sketched so far.

> **2022/06/19** - I am finally free from my exams! I am not planning to focus on this project 100% since I still have other stuff to work on aside from this small project. Anyways, I finally finished the sketch for **Sonozaki Oryou**. This time I will definitely write a new blog post regarding the new characters.

> New updates will be written on [Custom Deck of Cards Part 2](/blog/2022-07-10)
