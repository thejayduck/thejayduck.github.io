I mean, just the thought of having a physical something made by **you** is an amazing feeling in my opinion. I get to work on a new form of project and also, I can use this project as an excuse to improve my art.\n\n### What Inspired Me? 🤔\n<!-- During the development of the Tamagochi game, my friends and I decided to print a dress-up sticker set of the dog with some in-game clothing. And that re-embarked my obsession with physical copies of projects I work on. Throughout my high school years, I used to print out some of the drawings I made onto sticker paper, and give them to my friends. This time I am planning on making a deck of cards with drawings of my own. -->\n\nThis whole idea of making my own card deck arose when I started playing card games such as **Uno** more often.\nAnother factor that helped me is during the development of the Tamagochi game, my friends and I decided to print a dress-up sticker set of the dog with some in-game clothing. And with that my passion for for physical objects of projects I work on was re-embarked.\n\nBut before I actually decided on a card game however, I thought about printing a custom laptop sticker, but I quickly scrapped that idea because, it would just ruin the aesthetic of my laptop and I had already printed more than enough stickers in the past.\nAfter spending more time thinking about what I could possibly bring into the real-world, I thought about working on my own card deck. Reason being, they are cheap to produce and I just needed to draw a crap load of characters. \n\n<br/>\n\nAs for what I was going to draw, I first thought about drawing original characters, however in my case, I prefer drawing a different character every time I draw something new, hence I never settle on a character that I can actually call 'original'. With this issue on hand, I decided to draw the cast of Higurashi characters. You might ask; \"But why?\", and I genuinely have no clue why, maybe it's because I'm too invested in the story for the past few months, or maybe it's because I can't think of any other characters to draw about.\n\n### Current Progress 📊\nThe deck will consist a set of 52+1 playing cards and a joker card. In total 13+1 characters. Each character except the joker will be printed 4 times. \n\n<br/>\n\nSo far, I roughly sketched out 4 characters, these include;\n\n|🂡 Ace          |🂮 King           |🂫 Jack           |🂭 Queen      |\n|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------|\n|![Mion][mion]  |![Satoko][satoko]|![Hanyuu][hanyuu]|![Rika][rika]|\n|Sonozaki Mion  |Houjou Satoko    |Hanyuu           |Furude Rika  |\n\n**Note: The images are cropped, the original resolution is around 1200x2000.**\n\n<br/>\n\nI am also planning on adding characters such as;\n\n|🂢 (Card of 2)|🂣 (Card of 3)|🂤 (Card of 4)|🂥 (Card of 5)|🂦 (Card of 6)|🂧 (Card of 7)|🂨 (Card of 8)|🂩 (Card of 9)|🂪 (Card of 10)|🃏 (Joker)|\n|---------------|------------|-----------|--------------|--------------|--------------|-----------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n|![Keiichi][keiichi]|![Rena][rena]|![Takano][takano]|![tomitake][tomitake]|![Oiishi][oiishi]|![Irie][irie]|![Chie][chie]|![Shion][shion]|![Satoshi][satoshi]|![Oryou][oryou]|\n|Maebara Keiichi    |Ryuuguu Rena |Takano Miyo      |Tomitake Jirou       |Kuraudo Oiishi   |Kyousuke Irie|Chie Rumiko  |Sonozaki Shion |Houjou Satoshi     |Sonozaki Oryou |\n\n**Note: The drawings above are NOT mine! They are the original sprites from the game. I put them here as a reference to the reader.**\n\n<br/>\n\nThe card each character will represent is already decided, but I might tweak some of them before the printing phase.\n\n### Other Requirements 📝\nAt the moment I am planning on making the cards the size of mini playing cards, the reason being, that they are smaller and more portable than regular poker cards.\nAnd so I searched around the internet until stumbled upon this amazing **[playing card template](https://www.magicianmasterclass.com/post/playing-card-template)** that provides high-quality card templates.\n\nFor the choice of materials, I settled on, **350gr paper with rounded edges, matte coated surface, and size of 5.4cm x 8cm**.\n\nAs for casing, my initial plan was to have a standard paper box, but one of my friends suggested that I use a custom printed plastic case instead. With that thought in mind I found some outstanding free 3D printable models from **[Cults3D](https://cults3d.com/en)**. Additionally, I will edit the model of my choice to engrave a custom Higurashi logo on it.\n\n### Afterword\nI wasn't planning on writing another blog post so soon and this long, but for some reason, I feel the need to write these, even though I know almost no one except 2 of my friends read them. Even if that is indeed the case I am happy to be able to write these posts on occasion. Thank you once again for reading this blog post, I will probably write another or update this one when I draw more characters. See you later 👋🏻!\n\n[mion]: https://i.imgur.com/dy8uNChb.png\n[satoko]: https://i.imgur.com/IHEVonkb.png\n[hanyuu]: https://i.imgur.com/pItxQavb.png\n[rika]: https://i.imgur.com/lT1ED93b.png\n\n[chie]: https://i.imgur.com/W9rj2btt.png\n[irie]: https://i.imgur.com/FHv7YsPt.png\n[keiichi]: https://i.imgur.com/zmLQFYyt.png\n[oiishi]: https://i.imgur.com/GvDxBhxt.png\n[oryou]: https://i.imgur.com/DrCV3dQt.png\n[rena]: https://i.imgur.com/TnknLqLt.png\n[satoshi]: https://i.imgur.com/3TAQtHdt.png\n[shion]: https://i.imgur.com/nTA2nDCt.png\n[takano]: https://i.imgur.com/Jca5nKft.png\n[tomitake]: https://i.imgur.com/kWESJA7t.png"},{"slug":"2022-05-15","title":"I Wrote My First Story","date":"Sun May 15 2022","image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1592819695396-064b9572a660?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=500&h=500&q=30","content":"# I Wrote My First Story 📕\n\n### Why I Started Writing ❓\nI consider myself a bookworm, especially when it comes to Japanese light novels. The unique stories authors in East Asia come up with always amazed me. I have to agree that some of the books they write are simply... weird to put in simple terms, but out of the bunch, some gems shine through.\nI've especially been obsessed with **Jobless Reincarnation** light novel that I read all 15 volumes within three months.\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/hsekiOm.jpg\" width=\"150px\" alt=\"Mushoku Tensei Volume 1 Cover\" />\n\nThe way the author expands on its already amazing world, and characters simply astonished me.\nAnyways back to the topic, after years of procrastinating on writing, I finally took my first step to improve my writing abilities by writing a... **fanfic**. Before you leave, no I did not write anything weird or sexual, I simply wanted to create a simple romantic spin-off of the series **Higurashi**. The reason I chose Higurashi is that one can create their own; Horror, Mystery, and Romance story with it. And with its already amazing cast of characters, it saves the person time to focus more on the plot of their spin-off.\n\n### What I Have Learned during the Past Week ✍🏻\nFor the short story, I challenged myself to write it within a week! And let me tell you, it was quite the ride that I am willing to take several more times. I had so much fun writing their specific character traits on paper, which allowed me to learn so much within the deadline I had set myself up to.\nI now have a deeper understanding of how each character reacts to certain situations, and with each other. The story has a lot of flaws, and they are to be expected, that's why I asked 2 of my close friends to read it once I was done with it. They both gave me their criticism on it, which I profoundly appreciate. Although writing is not going to be my future career, I will keep improving myself with more short stories before meddling with original stories of my own. \n\n### Afterword \nThank you for reading through my first ever blog post. I am planning on writing more posts in the upcoming months, or even weeks. See you later 👋🏻!"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
